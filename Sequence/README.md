# Task1 - Sequence

Create a templated "Sequence" class which has a key and an info variable that implements a singly-liked list.

Design and code enough functions in the "Sequence" class so that the produce function can be implemented.

The produce function takes as its arguments two sequences (seq_1, seq_2), two start positions (start_1, start_2), two fragment lengths (len_1, len_2) and a "chunk" count (limit).

"Chunk" is defined as len_1 elements from seq_1 followed by len_2 elements from seq_2.

The produce function should create a third sequence which will contain up to limit chunks, if both input sequences are large enough.

The start_1 and start_2 arguments tell from which element in seq_1 and seq_2 the produce function should start creating the chunks.<br>
