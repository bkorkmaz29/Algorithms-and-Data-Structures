Task

Create a templated "Ring" class which contains double linked list nodes which form a ring 
(the "next" pointer of the last list element points to the first list element and the "previous" pointer of the first list element points to the last list element).

Implement enough support functions so that an iterator for the "Ring" class can be implemented (see details in the attached template).

Implement the iterator class as well.
